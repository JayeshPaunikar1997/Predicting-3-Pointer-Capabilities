Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between NBA players’ physical attributes (height, wingspan, player position, etc. ), other aspects of their gameplay (passing, shooting efficiency from the free-throw line and everything under 23 ft), and their capability to score three-pointers- since three pointing shooting is valued highly in the modern game. We plan on exploring other questions as well, such as: Does the position affect the number of 3 point shots a player makes and the success rate of the shots? Which position is more natural for 3 point shooting? By exploring a potential relationship between players’ attributes and their shooting, we can ultimately form an attributes template for the coaching staff to look out for, while evaluating a potential free agent or tradable asset.
